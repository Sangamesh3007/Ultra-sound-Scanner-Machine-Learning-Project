# Ultra-sound-Scanner-Machine-Learning-Project
### Capstone Project
<br>
        In this project, the objective is to enhance the testing efficiency of an Ultrasound Scanner. With an initial dataset comprising 577 features and 1577 rows, optimization strategies were employed, including null values removal, outliers treatment, and elimination of zero-variance columns. Utilizing techniques such as multicollinearity assessment, the feature set was refined to 100 key variables. Data was Standardised using Standard Scaler.

        Utilizing logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and XGBoost, Classification models were constructed and compared using ROC-AUC values. The Random Forest model with the highest ROC-AUC was selected, providing a streamlined and efficient framework for proactive issue identification in Ultrasound Scanner testing. This approach enhances decision-making and efficiency in the testing process, contributing to improved overall performance and reliability.
